***What is***

A physical data visualization of the wi-fi traffic shown only through long exposure photos

***How it works***

The system is based is a portable device that detects the wi-fi traffic in every position during the walking and turn on and off sections of a vertical strip of blinking lights based on the intensity of the signal.
The final *product* can only be seen when long exposure photos of the walk are taken revealing a *graph* of the signal intensity.

***What does it mean***

It means that maybe in every place there's something to tell and to see, that we are constantly connected and that everything emits and receive data from something else.
Only throught time we can see the impact of our actions and communications layers constantly.

***What if***

What if we use low intensity/frequency sound waves to show the data connections and only with layering we can ear a result.
In this way a small actions makes a light sound but everything generate noise.
