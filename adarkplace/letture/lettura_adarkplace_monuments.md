***What is***

An art installation at the Peacock Visual Arts in Aberdeen that physically shows through yellow balls falling from a box on the ceiling the killings around the world, based on the publishing of online articles.

***How it works***

An acrylic box placed on the ceiling is filled with small yellow balls, like the one used in softair weapons.
The box is connected to a board that runs a software that monitors the news; every time someone is *killed* in an article give the command to drop a ball on the floor, slowly filling the room.

***What does it mean***

At first this can seem as a game, but when something tell us that ball = dead person something change.
Every ball drop we fell a sense of anxiety, and we wait the next one, and so on.
Small balls, likes the one from toy guns, are metaphor that in this world war and killing has become like a game.
We wait our end, inexorably, and we can do nothing in front of this balls falling.

***What if***

What if we make it a *civil rights* installation and we drop a ball every time on the web someone publish something against race, women, culture, traditions, human rights. Maybe everything placed in a square in front of the UN buildings.
