***What is***

A web based interactive visualization that shows the immigrants flow to Europe between 2012 and 2015.

***How it works***

Based on a public data published monthly by the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) The Flow uses Java to build an interactive visualization. The user can freely interact with it picking a country and visualizing the flow from or towards.

Three ways are made to visualize datas:
- choosing the speed of the visualization
- selecting a date in the timeline
- by hovering over a country in the map

***What does it mean***

It shows the crisis of the world we live.
People can't understand the real problem till they see it.
This project help us visualize that we are not alone, that our country problems are not only ours and that our decisions maybe affects other lifes.
This demystifies the thought that only some countries are in danger and have problems of immigration.

***What if***

We use the same map to visualize import/export of relevant/bad matters like weapons or money, not to expose something like drug traffics but bad trades between countries.
